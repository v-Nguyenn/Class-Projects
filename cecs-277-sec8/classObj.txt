ABET Student Outcomes : 
The course satisfies following ABET for CSLinks to an external site. (scroll down to  'Program Criteria' and click 'Computer Science and Similarly Named Computing Programs') student outcomes:

 

1. Analyze a complex computing problem and to apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions.
 

2. Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program’s discipline.
 

3. Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.
 

4. Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles.
 

5. Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program’s discipline.
 

6. Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to produce computing-based solutions.
 

Course Objectives: 
The student shall be able to:

1. Identify the concepts of the object-program paradigm to design large
software solutions.

2. Explain the main concepts of object programming, including class
design, inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, exception handling, bjects, streams, and iterators.

3. Apply the techniques of object-oriented programming to implement
large software solutions.

4. Justify the advantage of object-oriented programming for design
large-scale software.
